# ReemowteDok

 ***Built for ConUHacksVI***

## Installation

To run the app you need Node V16^ and Yarn.

First, install the dependencies
```yarn install```

Then, start the app
```yarn start```

## Inspiration
In remote and disconnected areas, medical research is an extremely hard and expensive task. Medical research and data-gathering do not mix well with illiteracy and internet disconnection. Printing, filling, and aggregating medical questionnaires in this context is very long and expensive.

## What it does
ReemowteDok allows medical professionals to register patients and fill questionnaires for them, quickly, easily, and fully offline. When the professional is connected to the internet, he can upload all the data he gathered to a centralized server.

## How we built it
We built this app using Expo and React-Native. It uses React to build cross-platform native mobile apps. For the server, we use Express.js, a web-server library on top of Node.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Most of the team was new to React-Native, so we needed to acclimate ourselves to a new way to use React.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud to have built an application that works and that could be used to help medical research across the world, without discrimination of internet connectivity of literacy, in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about building a multi-screen and well-routed React-Native application. We learned a UI library named React-Native-Paper that was new to everyone.

## What's next for ReemowteDok
We want to port this application to production and test it against the real world! We really see a potential to accelerate and diversify medical research. Itwould also be great to analyze the data we collected and build machine learning model around those.
